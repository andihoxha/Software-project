Compare effectiveness of different classification algorithms in Sentiment analysis of game reviews and develop a system prototype for sentiment prediction and explanation in reviews of the Steam platform

1. My project is about doing a senetiment analysis of steam game reviews by analyzing them using Python language and other tools. Firstly, I will extract all text reviews from Steam platform dataset. Then text will go under pre-processing, used in classification algorithms to determine the accuracy of these algorithms, and more importantly in the end create some simple prototype that hihglight the words that affect the sentiment of review.
